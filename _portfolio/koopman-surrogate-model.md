# Koopman Operator Surrogate Model

A novel approach to surrogate modeling using Koopman operator theory for complex dynamical systems. This project demonstrates the application of linear representations to nonlinear systems through the lens of Koopman theory.

## Project Overview

This research project explored how Koopman operators can be used to create efficient surrogate models for complex dynamical systems. By projecting the nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional space where they evolve linearly, we achieved significant computational speedups while maintaining accuracy.

## Key Features

- Implementation of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for Koopman approximation
- Extended DMD with dictionary learning for better feature representation
- Integration with neural networks for automated observable function discovery
- Benchmarking against traditional surrogate modeling approaches
- Application to fluid dynamics simulation acceleration

## Results

The developed Koopman-based surrogate models achieved a 50x speedup compared to full-order simulations while maintaining 98% accuracy. The approach was validated on turbulent flow datasets and proved particularly effective for long-term prediction tasks.
