# Personal Portfolio Website

A retro-inspired portfolio website featuring Y2K design aesthetics and modern web technologies. This project showcases my work while paying homage to the nostalgic web design of the early 2000s.

## Project Overview

This personal portfolio site blends nostalgic Y2K design elements with modern web development practices. The project demonstrates how to create an accessible, responsive website while incorporating playful retro aesthetics.

## Key Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Y2K-inspired visual elements and animations
- Jekyll static site generator for easy content management
- Optimized performance with 95+ PageSpeed score
- Integrated blog with syntax highlighting for code snippets

## Implementation Details

The site uses Jekyll as a static site generator with custom layouts and includes. CSS animations bring the Y2K aesthetic to life, while JavaScript provides interactive elements like filtering and dynamic content loading. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for reliable, fast delivery.
