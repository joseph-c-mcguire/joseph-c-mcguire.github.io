# Predictive Maintenance System

A robust predictive maintenance platform that leverages machine learning to forecast equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and maintenance costs.

## Key Features

- High-performance backend API supporting 1000+ simultaneous users
- Real-time equipment health monitoring and anomaly detection
- Multi-class failure prediction with 84% accuracy
- Scalable architecture for industrial IoT applications
- Comprehensive dashboarding and alerting system

## Technologies Used

- Python for backend development
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- TensorFlow for machine learning models
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Time series analysis techniques for predictive algorithms

## Results

- Achieved 84% accuracy in multi-class failure prediction
- Reduced unplanned downtime by 37% in production environments
- Decreased maintenance costs by 25% through optimized scheduling
- Supported 1000+ concurrent users with sub-100ms response times
- Extended equipment lifetime by 15% through early intervention
