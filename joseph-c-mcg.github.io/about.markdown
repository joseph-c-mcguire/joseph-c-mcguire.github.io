I’m passionate about developing AI/ML applications that address pressing issues such as climate change and healthcare. My role as a Research Engineer at AIMdyn Inc. allows me to work on innovative solutions in these areas.
        
AIMdyn Inc. is a specialized research and development consultancy focusing on Koopman operator theory and time-series predictive modeling. As the Principal Investigator (PI) for the DARPA SCEPTER program, I lead our efforts in advanced research and manage multiple proposal initiatives centered on AI/ML applications.
        
I’m always eager to collaborate with professionals from diverse fields. If you’re interested in working together or exploring new ideas, please feel free to reach out!
