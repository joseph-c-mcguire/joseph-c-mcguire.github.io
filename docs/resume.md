  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>As a Research Engineer at AIMdyn, Inc., I lead our efforts on DARPA’s SCEPTER program in collaboration with BAE Systems’ KHAOSRAZOR program, serving as the Principal Investigator for AIMdyn. In my role as Senior Technical Personnel, I collaborate closely with senior management on research strategy, bids, and proposal efforts. I help shape AIMdyn’s AI/ML strategy for new proposals and partnerships, with a focus on Koopman operator theory and control applications.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’m an avid hiker, traveler, and cooking enthusiast. I’m also currently learning to fence.</p>
