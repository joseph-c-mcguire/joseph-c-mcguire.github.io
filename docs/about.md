# Advancing AI and Machine Learning in Control Systems and Predictive Modeling

As a Research Engineer at AIMdyn Inc., I am passionate about building impactful AI and machine learning technologies. My work focuses on addressing customer challenges with control systems, predictive modeling, and systems engineering.

I develop technologies that can forecast future scenarios, evaluate different system parameters, and design scalable applications for production environments used by engineers and scientists. My research is grounded in Koopman operator theory and control theory, as well as surrogate modeling and the creation of digital twins for physical systems. This work enables faster predictions, useful insights, and advanced methods for evaluating systems.

I've also worked on proposals and applications in the healthcare domain, specifically addressing Alzheimer's disease. I am privileged to work on pioneering projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible in these fields.

Whether you’re a researcher, engineer, practitioner, or someone with a novel idea, I am eager to explore potential collaborations. Let’s discuss how we can work together to drive forward our shared goals.

If you’re interested in collaborating, exchanging ideas, or connecting over mutual interests, please feel free to reach out!
